    <li id="faq1"><span class="question">What's a dual flush toilet?</span>
      <p>
        In short, it is toilet that saves a lot of water. 
        It uses about 4 less gallons per flush than the average toilet. 
        More specifically, a dual flush toilet has two-buttons. 
        You push one button for a half flush which uses 
        (.8 gallons) and another button for a full flush (1.6 gallons ).
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="faq2">How much water does a dual flush toilet save?
      <p>
        On average a dual flush toietls uses 1 gallon per flush as opposed to 5 gallons for a normal toilet.
        That saves 20 gallons a day, 7,000 gallons per year.
        If every toilet was a dual flush toilet, America would save 2 billion gallons of water each day.
      </p>
    </li>   
        
    <li id="faq3">How can a dual flush toilet save me money?
      <p>
        Toilets typically account for 30% of your home's water usage, which means a 
        chic dual flush toilet can significantly cut down your water bill. A family 
        of 4 can save 14,147 to 16,530 gallons of water per year and $77 to $90 each 
        year by simply upgrading to a new toilet.
      </p>
    </li>
        
    <li id="faq4">Is a dual flush toilet easy to install?
      <p>
        Dual flush toilets are just as easy to install as their dated counterparts, 
        and are just as effective. 
      </p>
    </li>        
        
    <li id="faq5">Where can I get spare parts for the dual toilets?
      <p>
        The parts for the dual flush toilets are very basic. They can be bought at 
        any plumbing supply warehouse or we can happily provide them for you.
      </p>
    </li>        
        
    <li id="faq6">How can a dual flush toilet use less water and still get the job done?
      <p>
        Dual flush toilets have improved on the typical gravity based flush by adding more force to 
        the water as it is flushing, so it can do more with less water.
      </p>
    </li>         
        
    <li id="faq7">Who are the manufacturers?
      <p>
	      The manufacturers are Faenza, Hegii, and Arrow. They are small manufacturers 
	      from China that produce our exclusive styles and are ISO 9001 certified.
      </p>

    <li id="faq8">What is the warranty?
      <p>

				any leading manufacturer (ie. Kohler, American Standard, etc). 
				However we are not responsible for the installation or removal costs.

    <li id="faq9">What is the best toilet you sell?
      <p>
				Honestly what toilet is best is completely depends on your personal taste and situation.
				We provide you a one piece or two piece, an elongate or a round bowl and a wall hung toilet.
				Their flush performance does not vary. They are all in my mind some of the best flushing
				toilets on the net. We usually put our best rated toilet on the front page. This is based on monthly sales.
