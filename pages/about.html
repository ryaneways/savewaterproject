<p>
  The Save Water Project was founded out of fun and love for water. 
  Our desire is to supply water saving toilets to water lovers. Although we 
  are a company that wishes to save water, we are not here to discuss the 
  negative statistics on Earth's water resources.
</p>

<h2>We are fun</h2>
<p>
  We prefer not to focus on cloudy days. Whether the statistics are right or 
  wrong is not relevant. We believe that water, along with all of nature's 
  resources, should be respected and used with reserve.
</p>

<h2>Our toilets</h2>
<p>
  Our toilets on average use one gallon per flush as opposed to five gallons 
  for a normal toilet. This saves 20 gallons of water per day, and 7,000 
  gallons of water per year.
</p>

<p>
  Our toilets are also attractive. They are based on the design of a master, 
  Philippe Starck. And we believe they invoke a certain elegance that reflects this.
</p>

<h2>Discounts</h2>
<p>
  We are offering a 20% discount for anyone who sends a pic of themselves 
  having fun on the water. In the event that you can not be on the water, 
  you can just send us a short water related poem.
</p>

<h2>Have a great day!</h2>
<p>
  We hope you have fun on our site and we look forward to serving you. If 
  you want to contact us, just go to the contact page.
